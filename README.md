My goal is to be good at what I do. How do I define that? Simple: I don't want to just bring high quality code to any project I work on but to do so elegantly and efficiently.

I believe developers should prioritize the needs of the business over the needs of the project, meaning doing what it takes to increase conversions, user retention, and reduce the cost of development without sacrificing usability, security, or performance.
